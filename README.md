Introduction
The self-driving car study project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for individuals interested in understanding the basics of autonomous vehicles. The project focuses on creating a simulated environment where a car can navigate and make decisions based on predefined rules and inputs.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:

- JavaScript: The main programming language used for implementing the logic and functionality of the self-driving car.
- HTML: Used for structuring the web page and creating the user interface elements.
 -CSS: Used for styling the web page and providing visual enhancements.

## Features
The self-driving car study project includes the following features:

- Simulated Environment: The project provides a virtual environment where the self-driving car operates. This environment includes roads, obstacles, and other elements to mimic real-world scenarios.
- Car Control: Users can interact with the car through a user interface. They can start or stop the car, change its speed, and observe its behavior in real-time.
- Decision Making: The self-driving car employs predefined rules and algorithms to make decisions while navigating the environment. These decisions may include stopping at red lights, avoiding obstacles, and following traffic rules.
- Real-Time Feedback: The project provides real-time feedback on the car's actions, including displaying the car's current speed, position, and any detected obstacles or traffic signals.
Getting Started
To get started with the self-driving car study project, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to launch the self-driving car simulation.
Usage
Once the self-driving car simulation is launched, you can interact with the car using the provided user interface. Some common actions you can perform include:

- Start/Stop: Use the start/stop button to control the car's movement.
- Speed Control: Adjust the car's speed using the speed control slider.
- Observation: Observe the car's behavior as it navigates the simulated environment, following traffic rules and avoiding obstacles.
Feel free to experiment and modify the project code to enhance the simulation or add new features.
